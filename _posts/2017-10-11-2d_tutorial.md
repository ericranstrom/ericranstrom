Unity has a published tutorial for constructing a 2d game with some simple animations - https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial  I'll be following this tutorial to get re-acquinted with the engine before jumping into my own project.  Try out the completed reference build for a peek at what I'll be trying to make.
